### Abstract

This study examines the spatial and socioeconomic determinants of violent crime in Buffalo, New York, from 2010 to 2023 using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Incorporating both fixed effects including per capita income, educational attainment, racial composition, and police surveillance camera presence, as well as random effects for census block groups, the model assesses how neighborhood characteristics influence violent crime occurrence. A spatially lagged covariate was included to account for spatial dependence in nearby areas. Results indicate that higher income and education levels are associated with reduced violent crime odds, while the presence of police cameras is associated with increased odds, likely due to heightened monitoring and reporting rather than actual increases in crime. Although these variables explain a significant portion of crime risk, random effects reveal substantial unexplained variation, particularly in historically disadvantaged areas like Buffaloâ€™s East Side and areas within the vicinity of downtown. Attempts to evaluate the causal impact of camera installation using a difference-in-differences approach were hindered by data limitations, including missing installation dates. While population-weighted areal interpolation was adequate for reconciling spatial mismatches in the dataset, alternative interpolation and modeling techniques may offer additional precision. The study underscores the utility of spatially informed GLMMs in urban crime research and illuminates the need for equitable surveillance infrastructure, improved data quality, and a more comprehensive collection of predictors that may include those capturing social cohesion and built environment factors to inform targeted violence prevention strategies.
